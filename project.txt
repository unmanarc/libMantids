- remove fastrpc (all interfaces)
- rename rpc to apiserver
- add rest support
- add websockets support
- remove remote auth server and client interfaces (what happens if I want a local project?)
- add ldap support (this must liberate much work)
- focus on what we are good at: networking (back with multiplexing, rawsockets)
- finish hive7
- remove jsoncpp, focus in boost (xml/json)
- create websockets proxy
- possible kerberos support?
- oauth2 support?

Scripting ideas:
- lua? python?
